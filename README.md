# UVaTour, a University of Virginia Tour Android Application

Created by [Brent Baumgartner](http://brentbaum.com), Jack Dingilian, and Alex Thomas.

## Project Information

UVaTour does what its name suggests: give a tour of UVa's grounds. It uses the Google Directions API to overlay routes to destinations a la Google Maps. It gives the history of major historical landmarks around UVa as part of the tour.

This app was created during a project in CS2110. It earned the top spot in the class for its aesthetics and functionality. 

To run this project, you must build it locally. It will be published to the Android app store soon!

*Note that it can currently only be used on tablets running Android 4.2 (We developed it originally on a Nexus 7).*
