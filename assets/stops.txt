The Rotunda
Designed by Thomas Jefferson to be the architectural and academic heart of the "academical village". It was modeled after the Pantheon in Rome and was originally used primarily as a library. A fire destroyed much of it in 1895 and it wasn't restored to its true historical form until 1975.

The Lawn Rooms
The rooms surrounding the lawn are also a part of the original architecture of the school. The smaller rooms housed the students while the larger parts housed professors and also served as classrooms. It is considered very prestigeous to be selected to live in a lawn room today.
